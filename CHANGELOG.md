## [3.5.1] - 2025-10-26
### Features
- New password reset endpoint: /user/savePassword
  - Implements the missing step in the password reset flow: validates a reset token and saves a new password.
  - Accepts SavePasswordDto { token, newPassword, confirmPassword } with validation.
  - Enforces full password policy (length, complexity, common password prevention, history, similarity).
  - Returns localized messages and a login redirect path on success.

### Fixes
- Hardened password management and validation
  - Update password now enforced by policy:
    - The /updatePassword endpoint validates the new password against the configured policy (history, similarity, complexity) before saving, preventing weak or reused passwords.
  - Complete password reset flow:
    - Added /user/savePassword endpoint with full validation and token checks.
    - Optimized reset token invalidation:
      - Added PasswordResetTokenRepository.deleteByToken(@Modifying @Query) to delete via a single DELETE statement.
      - UserService.deletePasswordResetToken() now uses the direct delete method and logs the deletion, reducing DB round trips.
    - Clarified password matching:
      - Documented that using String.equals() to compare two user-provided inputs (new vs confirm) is safe; constant-time comparison is needed only when comparing against stored secrets (handled by PasswordEncoder).
  - Reduced risk of race conditions during password history cleanup:
    - Added @Transactional(isolation = SERIALIZABLE) to UserService.cleanUpPasswordHistory to ensure atomic trimming of history entries during concurrent updates.
  - JPA mapping and performance improvements:
    - Adjusted PasswordHistoryEntry/User relationships for LAZY fetching and cascade delete to reduce unnecessary loads and avoid orphaned entries.
  - Internationalized messages:
    - Added message.password.mismatch and message.reset-password.success keys for clearer user feedback.

### Breaking Changes
- None in API surface. However, behavior is intentionally stricter:
  - Password updates that previously succeeded with weak/reused passwords will now be rejected per policy.
  - Applications relying on lax validation may see new 400 responses from /updatePassword and /savePassword until client-side validation and UX are aligned.

### Refactoring
- Repository-level optimization for token deletion:
  - Introduced deleteByToken() JPQL delete in PasswordResetTokenRepository and migrated service logic to use it.
- Minor code comments and documentation improvements in UserAPI for clarity and audit logging.

### Documentation
- README
  - Updated dependency examples from 3.4.1 → 3.5.0 and then to 3.5.1 for both Maven and Gradle snippets.
- DEMO_APP_CHANGES_REQUIRED.md (new)
  - Detailed steps to fix demo app password reset form:
    - Change form action to /user/savePassword.
    - Add name="confirmPassword" to the confirm field to match SavePasswordDto.
  - Notes on reusing the existing registration password strength meter in reset/update flows; reduced estimated effort (1–2 hours).
  - Optional consistency update: rename currentPassword → oldPassword in update-password.js to match backend DTO (non-breaking).
  - Comprehensive testing checklist for reset/update/registration flows.
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PASSWORD_FIXES.md (new)
  - Full analysis and plan covering:
    - Adding validation to /updatePassword.
    - Implementing /savePassword with DTO, token checks, and policy enforcement.
    - Design decision: history checks apply to existing users; registration passes user=null by design.
    - Transaction isolation choice for history cleanup and concurrent-change considerations.

### Testing
- All existing tests pass (372 tests), confirming no regressions.
- The plan documents recommended additional unit and integration tests for reset/update flows; no new test files were added in the provided diffs.

### Other Changes
- CI/CD and Developer Experience
  - Added GitHub Actions workflows:
    - .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml: Automated PR code reviews using anthropics/claude-code-action@v1 with limited gh tool permissions and review prompts.
    - .github/workflows/claude.yml: On-demand “@claude” assistant for issues and PRs with permissions to read CI results and repository metadata.
- Release and versioning
  - Bumped project version to 3.5.1-SNAPSHOT in gradle.properties to begin the next development iteration.

Notes for integrators
- Update any client UI that performs password reset:
  - Post to /user/savePassword with fields: token, newPassword, confirmPassword.
  - Expect localized error messages and strict validation failures for policy violations.
- Consider surfacing the same password strength and requirements UX used in registration on reset/update screens to align with backend enforcement.

## [3.5.0] - 2025-10-26
### Features
- Password policy enforcement integrated into registration and password updates
  - New PasswordPolicyService enforces configurable rules:
    - Length limits (min/max), required character classes (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special)
    - Allowed special characters are fully configurable via user.security.password.special-chars
    - Common password prevention using a Passay dictionary built from bundled common_passwords.txt
    - Username/email similarity check using Levenshtein distance with a configurable similarity threshold
    - Password history reuse prevention using stored password hashes and a configurable history-count
  - UserAPI now validates passwords on registration and returns HTTP 400 with aggregated error messages if policy fails
  - Key implementation details:
    - Passay-based validation with a MessageSource-backed PasswordValidator for localized error messages
    - Dictionary initialization uses WordListDictionary and ArrayWordList; optimized sorting via ArraysSort for faster startup
    - Similarity computed with Apache Commons Text LevenshteinDistance; threshold is percentage-based
    - Password history checks query the latest N hashes via PasswordHistoryRepository.findRecentPasswordHashes(Pageable)
    - History is recorded automatically on changeUserPassword and during registration where applicable

- Password history persistence and automatic cleanup
  - New JPA entity PasswordHistoryEntry stores per-user password hashes with timestamps
  - New repository PasswordHistoryRepository offers:
    - findRecentPasswordHashes(user, pageable) for efficient reuse checks
    - findByUserOrderByEntryDateDesc(user) for cleanup
  - UserService now:
    - Saves hashed passwords to history on password changes
    - Cleans up old entries after saves to limit stored history per configured history-count

- Database-level integrity and performance for password history
  - PasswordHistoryEntry now enforces:
    - passwordHash length capped at 255 and not null (safe for bcrypt, etc.)
    - entryDate not null and mapped as entry_date
  - Indexes added:
    - idx_user_id on user_id
    - idx_entry_date on entry_date
  - Improves performance for queries like findByUserOrderByEntryDateDesc and general cleanup operations

- Build and tooling enhancements
  - Gradle wrapper updated to 9.1.0
  - Apache Commons Text upgraded to 1.14.0

### Fixes
- Correct password history cleanup off-by-one error
  - Previously kept only historyCount entries; now keeps historyCount + 1 (current + N previous) to actually prevent reuse of the Nth previous password
  - Implementation: compute maxEntries = historyCount + 1 and delete entries beyond that index

- Robust password policy configuration parsing
  - Fixed escaping for special characters in dsspringuserconfig.properties
  - Removed surrounding quotes from user.security.password.special-chars so all characters (including backslash and quotes) parse correctly

- Faster and more predictable common password dictionary initialization
  - Updated Passay WordLists.createFromReader to use new ArraysSort() for sorting, improving startup performance and consistency

- Stabilized unit tests by properly stubbing PasswordPolicyService in UserAPI tests
  - Prevented NPE by returning Collections.emptyList() from validate()

### Breaking Changes
- New required configuration properties for password policy
  - PasswordPolicyService uses @Value without defaults for multiple properties (e.g., user.security.password.enabled, min-length, max-length, require-* flags, special-chars, prevent-common-passwords, history-count, similarity-threshold).
  - If you use UserAPI (now depends on PasswordPolicyService), you must supply these properties or import a property source that defines them. Otherwise, application startup may fail.
  - Behavior change: registration and password updates are now rejected (HTTP 400) when password policy is not met.

- Database schema changes
  - New table password_history_entry with not-null constraints and indexes
  - If you manage schema outside of Hibernate auto-DDL, you must add this table, columns, and indexes in your migrations before deploying.

Migration guidance:
- Add the new properties to your application configuration (example):
  - user.security.password.enabled=true
  - user.security.password.min-length=8
  - user.security.password.max-length=128
  - user.security.password.require-uppercase=true
  - user.security.password.require-lowercase=true
  - user.security.password.require-digit=true
  - user.security.password.require-special=true
  - user.security.password.special-chars=~`!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]|\\:;"'<>,.?/
  - user.security.password.prevent-common-passwords=true
  - user.security.password.history-count=3
  - user.security.password.similarity-threshold=80

- Apply DB migration to create password_history_entry with:
  - Columns: id (PK), user_id (FK), password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, entry_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
  - Indexes: idx_user_id(user_id), idx_entry_date(entry_date)

### Refactoring
- PasswordPolicyService structure and error handling improved
  - Extracted validation into cohesive private methods:
    - buildPassayRules(), createSpecialCharacterRule()
    - checkPasswordHistory(), checkPasswordSimilarity()
    - validateWithPassay()
  - Early returns for failed history/similarity checks to avoid unnecessary work
  - More detailed debug logging and clearer severe-error logging for dictionary load failures
  - Optional used for null-safe error signaling from pre-checks

### Documentation
- Enhanced Spring configuration metadata
  - additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json updated with meaningful descriptions for the new password policy properties, improving IDE assistance and documentation

### Testing
- New and updated test coverage
  - PasswordPolicyServiceIntegrationTest ensures:
    - Properties load correctly from config file
    - Allowed special characters are correctly parsed and enforced
    - Validation behaves as expected in a real Spring context
  - PasswordPolicyServiceTest fixes
    - Corrected similarity test to pass username/email to validate(), ensuring the check is truly exercised
  - UserAPIUnitTest updates
    - Added a mock PasswordPolicyService and default stubbing to prevent NPEs
  - Broader test additions from the password policy feature:
    - New tests for PasswordPolicyService and expanded UserService tests to cover history and policy integration

### Other Changes
- Versioning and editor configuration
  - Project version bumped to 3.5.0-SNAPSHOT
  - Added VS Code Java settings to .vscode/settings.json

- Dependency updates
  - Runtime:
    - com.google.guava:guava 33.4.8-jre → 33.5.0-jre
    - org.apache.commons:commons-text 1.13.1 → 1.14.0
    - org.springframework.boot 3.5.5 → 3.5.6
    - org.projectlombok:lombok 1.18.38 → 1.18.42
  - Test:
    - com.h2database:h2 2.3.232 → 2.4.240
    - com.icegreen:greenmail 2.1.5 → 2.1.7
    - org.assertj:assertj-core 3.27.4 → 3.27.6
  - Build:
    - com.github.ben-manes.versions plugin 0.52.0 → 0.53.0
    - Removed unused dependencyUpdates config and related helper from build.gradle (cleanup)

What this means for you:
- If you consume this library’s UserAPI endpoints, define the new password policy properties and run DB migrations for password history before upgrading.
- Expect stricter password handling during registration and updates, with clear, localized error messages reported to clients when policy checks fail.
- Performance during startup when loading the common password dictionary should improve due to the new ArraysSort usage.

## [3.4.1] - 2025-09-04
### Features
- No new feature functionality introduced in these commits.

### Fixes
- Hardened audit logging to prevent NullPointerException on first-time OAuth registration when the user ID is null (Fixes #210).
  - FileAuditLogWriter:
    - Null-safe extraction of user fields. New subject resolution order for the 4th pipe-delimited field: user ID (if present) → email (if ID is null) → "unknown".
    - Catches and logs IOException and any other Exception to ensure audit failures never impact application flow.
    - Uses log.error for audit system failures.
  - AuditEventListener:
    - Wraps event handling in try/catch to suppress and log unexpected errors from configuration checks or writer failures.
  - Impact:
    - Prevents application crashes during first-time OAuth registration or other scenarios where user.getId() is null.
    - Compatibility note for log consumers: the user identifier field may now contain an email address or the literal "unknown" when no numeric ID is available. If your log processing expects a numeric ID, update parsers accordingly.

### Breaking Changes
- None.

### Refactoring
- None.

### Documentation
- Updated README dependency coordinates to version 3.4.1 for both Maven and Gradle.

### Testing
- Substantial test coverage added around audit logging for null-safety and robustness:
  - AuditEventListenerTest:
    - Ensures events with a user that has a null ID are handled and logged.
    - Verifies exceptions thrown by the writer are suppressed and do not propagate.
    - Verifies exceptions during audit configuration checks are suppressed and the writer is not called.
  - New FileAuditLogWriterTest (403 lines):
    - Null-safety cases: null user, null ID, null ID + null email, normal user with ID.
    - Error handling: IOException on write, uninitialized writer, unexpected exceptions during event access.
    - Setup and configuration: disabled logging, null config object, empty log file path.
    - Writer lifecycle: flush and cleanup behaviors.
- Overall increases resilience and confidence in the audit subsystem through 15+ targeted test cases.

### Other Changes
- Bumped project version to 3.4.1-SNAPSHOT in gradle.properties via Gradle Release Plugin (development iteration; no runtime behavior change).

## [3.4.0] - 2025-09-03
### Features
- Proxy-aware URL and IP detection
  - UserUtils.getAppUrl now builds correct external URLs when behind proxies/load balancers by honoring X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Port; the generated URL always includes a port for backward compatibility
  - UserUtils.getClientIP now checks multiple standard headers in priority order (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, CF-Connecting-IP, True-Client-IP) with clean fallbacks
- Remember‑me is now opt‑in and explicitly configurable
  - Disabled by default; enable only when you set both properties:
    - user.security.rememberMe.enabled=true
    - user.security.rememberMe.key=<your-static-secret-key>
- Role hierarchy applied to method security
  - Method security expressions now honor the configured hierarchy (e.g., ROLE_ADMIN > ROLE_USER) via a MethodSecurityExpressionHandler wired with the RoleHierarchy
- Stronger password validation for registration
  - New @PasswordMatches class‑level constraint and validator; registration now enforces password and matchingPassword equality, with clear validation errors
- Safer OAuth2/OIDC account creation
  - Email is validated and normalized (lowercased) for OAuth2 and OIDC providers; authentication fails early with a clear, user‑friendly message if the provider didn’t supply an email (e.g., missing scope/permission)
- Audit logging hardening and defaults
  - FileAuditLogWriter concurrency is now protected with synchronized methods
  - Default audit log location changed to ./logs with automatic creation; graceful fallback to system temp directory if not writable
  - Periodic flush scheduling only active when audit logging is enabled and flushOnWrite is false
- Password reset API refinement
  - New PasswordResetRequestDto introduced; endpoint continues to send reset emails but now cleanly models the request as { "email": "..." }

### Fixes
- Security and privacy hardening
  - Removed session IDs from debug logs to prevent sensitive data exposure
  - CustomOAuth2AuthenticationEntryPoint now returns generic user‑friendly messages and logs detailed errors internally
  - Enforced lowercase normalization for emails throughout registration and OAuth2/OIDC paths, preventing duplicate users by case variance
- Robust null/edge‑case handling
  - Fixed potential NPE in UserService.getUserByPasswordResetToken when token or token record is null
  - UserService.registerNewUserAccount now validates password matching before proceeding
- Correct URL generation in emails
  - Registration verification emails now use UserUtils.getAppUrl(request), fixing previously broken links that used only the context path
- JPA entity equality fixes
  - Role and Privilege equals/hashCode now based on id only; bidirectional relationships excluded to avoid recursion/stack overflows and to improve Set behavior in persistence contexts
- Build/packaging correctness for consumers
  - Fixed published artifact name to ds-spring-user-framework
  - Removed surprise transitive runtime dependencies from the library (devtools, database drivers) by moving them to test runtime scope
- Configuration correctness and resilience
  - Fixed CSRF property typo: user.security.disableCSRFdURIs → user.security.disableCSRFURIs
  - Hardened parsing of comma‑delimited URI properties to ignore empty/whitespace entries
- Logging and code quality
  - Replaced string concatenation in logs with parameterized logging throughout
  - Fixed JavaDoc syntax issues in JSONResponse

### Breaking Changes
- Password reset endpoint request body
  - /user/resetPassword now expects PasswordResetRequestDto instead of UserDto
  - Migration: change the request body to { "email": "user@example.com" }
- Configuration property rename
  - user.security.disableCSRFdURIs → user.security.disableCSRFURIs
  - Migration: update your application properties/yaml accordingly
- Remember‑me behavior
  - Previously could be active with an ephemeral key; now disabled by default and only enabled when both user.security.rememberMe.enabled=true and user.security.rememberMe.key are set
- MailService bean construction
  - MailService now uses constructor injection for both JavaMailSender and MailContentBuilder
  - Migration: if you construct MailService manually, pass both dependencies; Spring auto‑config will wire it automatically in typical setups
- OAuth2/OIDC email requirement
  - Authentication now fails if the provider does not return an email address; ensure the email scope/permission is granted

### Refactoring
- WebSecurityConfig
  - Simplified remember‑me configuration; created DaoAuthenticationProvider via constructor; used RoleHierarchyImpl.fromHierarchy; reduced boilerplate and improved readability
- UserUtils
  - Streamlined IP header checks and forward‑aware app URL construction; clarified JavaDoc
- General logging cleanup
  - Consistent use of parameterized logging; removed System.out and noisy concatenation

### Documentation
- Major README overhaul
  - Step‑by‑step Quick Start with prerequisites, dependencies (Thymeleaf, Mail, JPA, Security, Spring Retry), database examples (MariaDB/PostgreSQL/H2), email setup, and complete example configuration
  - Clear explanation of registration modes: auto‑enable vs email verification, with expected behavior and configuration
  - Guidance on customizing views and next steps
- Configuration metadata fixes
  - property names corrected (camelCase), types fixed (Boolean/Integer), missing properties added for better IDE assistance

### Testing
- Substantial test coverage added across critical paths
  - OAuth2/OIDC services
    - DSOAuth2UserServiceTest (≈15 tests): Google/Facebook flows, new vs existing users, provider conflicts, error handling
    - DSOidcUserServiceTest (≈14 tests): Keycloak flows, claims extraction, DSUserDetails integration, conflict scenarios
  - Security utilities and flows
    - UserUtilsTest (≈29 tests): IP extraction header priority and URL building
    - CustomOAuth2AuthenticationEntryPointTest (≈21 tests): exception handling, redirects, failure handler delegation
    - LoginHelperServiceTest (≈15 tests): last activity tracking, automatic unlock, authorities handling, edge cases
    - LogoutSuccessServiceTest (≈17 tests): audit event creation, IP extraction, URL resolution, exception scenarios
    - RolePrivilegeSetupServiceTest (≈15 tests): initialization, reuse of privileges, transactional handling, mixed existing/new entities
  - Mail
    - MailServiceTest (≈24 tests): simple/template sends, async behavior, retry/recovery, edge cases
  - Validation
    - PasswordMatchesValidatorTest: positive/negative cases for password confirmation
- Test infrastructure improvements
  - Added fixture builders for OAuth2/OIDC users (Google, Facebook, Keycloak) for realistic claims and attributes
  - Dependency updates for test stack (AssertJ, ArchUnit, Awaitility, Testcontainers, Rest‑Assured, GreenMail)

### Other Changes
- Dependency updates
  - Spring Boot 3.5.5
  - Test libraries: AssertJ 3.27.4, ArchUnit 1.4.1, Awaitility 4.3.0, Testcontainers 1.21.3, Rest‑Assured 5.5.6, GreenMail 2.1.5

Migration checklist
- Update /user/resetPassword client requests to use PasswordResetRequestDto { "email": "..." }
- Rename user.security.disableCSRFdURIs to user.security.disableCSRFURIs
- If you rely on remember‑me, add:
  - user.security.rememberMe.enabled=true
  - user.security.rememberMe.key=<stable-secret>
- Ensure OAuth2/OIDC providers grant email scope; otherwise login will fail by design
- If constructing MailService manually, pass both JavaMailSender and MailContentBuilder
- Be aware that emails are now normalized to lowercase; verify database uniqueness constraints if case sensitivity was previously assumed

This changelog captures nuanced improvements and ensures that developers and users of the project are aware of the recent enhancements and bugfixes, to maintain alignment with the latest codebase optimizations.

## [3.2.1] - 2025-04-13
# Changelog

## Features
- **User Account Deletion Improvements (80f7c474, 1c42d603):** Added comprehensive handling for user account deletions. A new event, `UserPreDeleteEvent`, is published before a user is deleted, allowing applications to clean up related data. This supports both logical disablement (setting `enabled=false`) and actual deletion from the database, controlled by the `user.actuallyDeleteAccount` configuration.

## Fixes
- **User Deletion Cascading Fix (80f7c474, 1c42d603):** Addressed the issue where deleting a user did not cascade to `BaseUserProfile` subclasses. The fix ensures that all related data can be cleaned upon user deletion, preventing orphaned data.
- **Google SSO Login Error (9a891b2a, 094a5341, b294d43d):** Resolved an error when logging in with Google SSO by updating dependencies and enhancing the logging within the authentication process for better tracking and debugging.
  
## Breaking Changes
- **Authentication Process Refactor (b294d43d):** The `DSUserDetails` class no longer implements the `OAuth2User` interface. Applications relying on `OAuth2User` from `DSUserDetails` need to update their logic accordingly.

## Refactoring
- **Improved Test Setup in `UserServiceTest` (7285da93):** Refactored imports and utilized a mock for `ApplicationEventPublisher`, improving the modularity and maintainability of tests.

## Documentation
