# Failing Tests Analysis

## Summary
As of July 21, 2025, there are 18 failing tests out of 232 total tests (92% passing).
Failures are in authentication-related integration tests and async event handling tests.

## Failing Tests Details

### 1. AuthenticationIntegrationTest (5 failures)

#### Test: `login_validCredentials_authenticatesAndRedirects`
- **Issue**: Login with valid credentials is being rejected
- **Expected**: Redirect to `/index.html?messageKey=message.loginSuccess`
- **Actual**: Redirect to `/user/login.html?error`
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - user is created with properly encoded password, but authentication fails

#### Test: `login_withRememberMe_setsRememberMeCookie`
- **Issue**: Same as above - valid login being rejected
- **Expected**: Successful login with remember-me
- **Actual**: Login failure

#### Test: `showLoginPage_unauthenticated_showsLoginPageOrNotFound`
- **Issue**: Template rendering error
- **Error**: `TemplateInputException: Error resolving template [user/login]`
- **Root Cause**: Test environment doesn't have Thymeleaf templates

#### Test: `accessProtectedResource_authenticated_allowsAccess`
- **Issue**: @WithMockUser not working with UserAPI endpoint
- **Error**: `SecurityException: User not logged in`
- **Root Cause**: UserAPI.validateAuthenticatedUser() checks for actual authentication, not mocked

#### Test: `login_withSavedRequest_redirectsToOriginalUrl`
- **Issue**: Login fails, so saved request redirect doesn't work
- **Root Cause**: Same as valid credentials test

### 2. SecurityConfigurationTest (2 failures)

#### Test: `formLogin_validCredentials_authenticatesUser`
- **Issue**: Authentication fails with valid credentials
- **Error**: `Authentication should not be null`
- **Root Cause**: Same authentication issue as AuthenticationIntegrationTest

#### Test: `accessProtectedEndpoint_authenticated_allowsAccess`
- **Issue**: @WithMockUser not working with UserAPI endpoint
- **Error**: `SecurityException: User not logged in`
- **Root Cause**: Same as AuthenticationIntegrationTest

## Common Patterns

1. **Valid Login Failures**: The main issue is that valid logins are being rejected. This suggests:
   - Possible mismatch between test data setup and authentication configuration
   - Spring Security configuration in tests might be different from expected
   - Password encoding/matching issue despite correct setup

2. **Template Rendering**: Tests expecting HTML responses fail because templates don't exist in test environment
   - Could be fixed by using REST endpoints or mocking template resolution

3. **Mock Authentication**: @WithMockUser doesn't satisfy UserAPI's authentication checks
   - UserAPI uses custom validation that checks actual authentication state
   - Would need to use real authentication or modify tests to use different endpoints

## Recommendations for Fixing

1. **For login failures**: 
   - Add more debug logging to see what's happening during authentication
   - Check if Spring Security configuration is loaded correctly in tests
   - Verify the authentication manager configuration

2. **For template issues**:
   - Mock template resolution
   - Use REST endpoints instead of page endpoints
   - Add test templates

3. **For mock authentication**:
   - Use actual authentication flow instead of @WithMockUser
   - Or use endpoints that rely on Spring Security instead of custom checks

### 3. EventSystemIntegrationTest (8 failures)

#### Tests: Registration event flow tests
- **Issue**: Async event handling timeout
- **Error**: `CountDownLatch.await() returned false`
- **Root Cause**: @Async events not being processed synchronously in tests
- **Fix**: Need to configure synchronous TaskExecutor for tests

#### Tests: Authentication event flow tests  
- **Issue**: Similar async timeout issues
- **Root Cause**: Same as above

#### Tests: Event ordering tests
- **Issue**: Async processing makes event order non-deterministic
- **Root Cause**: Tests assume synchronous processing

## Test Coverage Achieved

Despite these failures, we successfully added comprehensive test coverage for:
- DSUserDetailsService (10 tests, 100% passing)
- AuthorityService (15 tests, 100% passing) 
- LoginSuccessService (6 tests, 100% passing)
- LoginAttemptService (5 tests, 100% passing - already existed)
- UserService (Enhanced from 6 to 26 tests, 100% passing)
- UserAPI (20 tests, 100% passing)
- UserActionController (11 tests, 100% passing)
- UserPageController (19 tests, 100% passing)
- UserEmailService (12 tests, 100% passing)
- RegistrationListener (8 tests, 100% passing)
- AuthenticationEventListener (10 tests, 100% passing)
- AuditEventListener (13 tests, 100% passing)
- OnRegistrationCompleteEvent (6 tests, 100% passing)
- UserPreDeleteEvent (6 tests, 100% passing)

Total test count increased from ~79 to 232 tests, improving overall test coverage significantly. The failing tests are primarily integration tests with environmental dependencies (templates) or async processing issues.
