/**
 * This package contains the model classes for the user persistence layer of the Spring User Framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are responsible for representing the data structures and entities that are used to persist user information in the
 * database.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * These model classes typically include annotations for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as JPA (Java Persistence API) to facilitate
 * the mapping of Java objects to database tables.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The package is part of the larger Spring User Framework, which provides a comprehensive solution for user management, including registration,
 * authentication, and authorization.
 * </p>
